#Developer guide

This guide describes project's structure, instructs how to deploy your own working environment.

##Deploying working environment

This project initially developed under and for Ubuntu operating system, so most likely it should run on any other linux-based distributions, but it is possible that some steps of this instruction will be incorrect for another operating systems.

*First of all ensure that in your system installed required packages:*

    git, python-dev, python3.4-dev

*After that choose some directory as a project directory (i.e. ~/projects) mkdir it if necessary than cd to it. Clone repository:*

    git clone git@github.com:alekseyr/pyjobs.git

*Than build the environment:*

    ./build_env.sh

*Activate virtual environment:*

    source env/bin/activate

*You can use existing sqlite database, that set in settings.py with sample data for debugging purposes. Now you can run development server:*

    python src/manage.py runserver_plus localhost:8020

Your app will be available in [http://localhost:8020](http://localhost:8020) and django's admin interface in [http://localhost:8020/admin](http://localhost:8020/admin) Use user/user123 to login to django's admin interface.

####Congratulations! You have your own development environment.
